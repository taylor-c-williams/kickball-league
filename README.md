Description
After building out your local kickball league’s directory, some of the league’s managers decided it’s too much work to manually add/update/delete teams & players from the database. They’ve asked you to build an interface that allows them to create, update, and delete teams and players.

Note: Although the demo uses authentication, you do NOT need to build a sign in form in your app.
